[[ v0.2.5a / 2013-12-06 / Steam v.8 ]]


__ KNOWN ISSUES __

I had to dramatically scale back this release in order to get something pushed out early. I was trying to get too much out at the same time. I also wanted to publish something earlier to get feedback. I apologize in advance if this release is not as stable as the previous one. 

This is still in Alpha. My goal is to push out a small, rapid, sequence of fixes and patches to bring this 0.2.x version up to par. Once that is done, I will continue on to the v0.3.x release. (See notes below about future releases.)

- Strategic View: Icons don't show up.
- Timed Game: I need to determine the appropriate turn addition to each timed setting. Recommendations and feedback welcomed (always).
- AI improved but still falls short in some places.
- Start date (6000 BC) has comptability issues with other mods (to be fixed or possibly player controlled).
- Cooking Tech is a Placeholder and does nothing except annoy you. 
- Art/Gfx. This one was the killer for me and the reason it took me a lot longer to release the mod. I would love artist help :)

__ UPGRADE __

You may need to delete the mod cache to make this upgrade work. I had to do this once in order to get the new graphics to works.

- Build your Palace after researching the Leadership tech. 


__ COMPATIBILITY __

- *** I strongly advise to download this Mod as the LAST new mod before starting a new game! **
- It could  still work fine if you load other mods later, unless they are new Civilizations or mods that change/add technologies.
- If your REALLY like a new mod civilization (and they are overpowered early on or unbalance the game) let me know and I should be able to add an optional patch.
- To fix conflicts with mods which you downloaded later, follow the guide which you find in the mod's screenshots on top of this page. 
- Requires Brave New World (BNW) expansion. 
- Does not work with Mods that change GOODY HUTS (Ancient Ruins) or the SCOUT unit.
- *** Avoid using Mods that give any benefit AT THE START OF THE GAME, as you might end up unbalancing the game with overpowered units, buildings or features 2000 years too early! ***


__ BUGS AND SUGGESTIONS __

- Please send me your bugs and suggestions. This is my first mod, I would love the help.
- When sending bugs, please tell me the civ you were using, any other mods, and as much details as possible. 
- I am also taking suggestions for this mod (small fixes, tweaks, etc.) or for my much larger mod which will span millions of years of human history (see below).

__ PREHISTORIC v2.x __

I am creating a much larger mod, more historically accurate and larger in scope, covering a much larger span of man's history (20M BC), optionally starting from the Miocene Age somewhere during bipedal adaption -- "monkeys coming down from the trees". 

There are several starting era choices: 

-> Miocene 
-> Lower Paleolithic (tools, fire) 
-> Middle (crude art [beads], multi-tools, language, small bands) 
-> Upper Paleolithic (rope, needles, petroglyphs, first bow, cave painting) 
-> Mesolithic 
-> Neolithic 
-> Copper 
-> Bronze ... 

In order to prevent land-grab too early I am considering several things: 
- revealed areas becoming dark again after short periods 
- no settlers at the beginning! (alternative form of settler to create 'camps', 'gathering areas'). Very early game would be nomadic without camps.
- ice age changes disrupting civilization and land 
- natural disasters
- limited expansion once villages can be established 
- exploration limitations, such as forest civs having penalties in deserts. After all, early "man" took a long time to adapt and migrate.


__ PROJECT __

I need to "house" this project somewhere and I am new to this modding thing. Any ideas? Does anyone use Github? If I am to work with others I would need to have a collaboration center. What is the typical strategy for this?
