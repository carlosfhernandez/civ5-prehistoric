			<Description>Tree of Life</Description>
			<Strategy>The concept of a tree of life has been used in science, religion, philosophy, mythology, and other areas. A tree of life is a common motif in various world theologies, mythologies, and philosophies. A mystical concept alluding to the interconnection of all life on our planet; and a metaphor for common descent in the evolutionary sense. The term tree of life may also be used as a synonym for 'sacred tree'.[NEWLINE](Quoted from en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_life)</Strategy>
