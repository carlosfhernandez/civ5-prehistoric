KNOWN ISSUES

I had to dramatically scale back this release in order to get something pushed out early. I suppose I was trying to get too much out at the same time. That being said, I also wanted to publish something earlier rather than later, and trying to perfect an 'intermediate' release. I apologize in advance if this release is not as stable as the previous one. 

My goal is to push out a small, rapid, sequence of fixes and patches to bring this 0.2.x version up to par. Once that is done, I will continue on to the v. 0.3.x release. Version 0.x.x is still ALPHA. (See notes below about future releases.)

- Strategic View: Icons don't show up.
- Timed Game: Adding years at the beginning just lengthens that game. I need to determine the appropriate turn addition to each timed setting. Recommendations and feedback welcomed (always).
- AI improved but still falls short in some places.
- Start date (6000 BC) has major comptability issues with other mods (to be fixed or possibly player controlled).
- Cooking tech does nothing, and is a placeholder (kept like this to expidite release; I will patch soon).
- Art/Gfx. This one was the killer for me and the reason it took me a lot longer to release the mod. I would love artist help :)

UPGRADE

You may need to delete the mod cache to make this upgrade work. I had to do this once, for some reason, in order to get the new graphics to works.

______________________________ 

MORE INFO: 

- You will only get the "+3 Culture in the Capital" from the Tradition Policy Tree after building your Palace. 
- City Growth and Research have been slowed until the Classical Era, to avoid a too quick of progress.
- Build Shrines earlier, but Monuments later when discovering Masonry. 
- Goody Huts (Ancient Ruins) have been adapted to the new Era with smaller benefits. Removed Barbarian Camp Locations and Faith gains. 
- BNW: TODO: Goody Hut gains will improve to normal after Pottery. 
- Gold gifts from first contact with City States have been reduced. 
- The Huns' trait has been changed to grant a free Prehistoric tech instead of Animal Husbandry. 
- Huns, France, Celts, and the Aztecs traits have been changed to avoid too much culture/faith bonus too early. 
- BNW: Shoshone early unit changed. TODO: will slightly tweak Poland and Zulus traits. 
- All other unique abilities, units and buildings should work as intended. 

______________________________ 

COMPATIBILITY: 

- *** I strongly advise to download this Mod as the LAST new mod before starting a new game! **
- It should still work fine if you load other mods later, unless they are new Civilizations or mods that change/add technologies.
- If your REALLY like a new mod civilization (and they are overpowered early on or unbalance the game) let me know and I should be able to add an optional patch.
- To fix conflicts with mods which you downloaded later, follow the guide which you find in the mod's screenshots on top of this page. 
- Requires Brave New World (BNW) expansion. 
- Does not work with Mods that change Goody Huts (Ancient Ruins). 
- Does not work with Mods that change the Scout unit. 
- *** Avoid using Mods that give any benefit AT THE START OF THE GAME, as you might end up unbalancing the game with overpowered units, buildings or features 2000 years too early! ***

______________________________ 

PREHISTORIC v2.x

I am creating a much larger mod, more historically accurate and larger in scope, covering a much larger span of man's history (20M BC), optionally starting from the Miocene Age somewhere during bipedal adaption -- "monkeys coming down from the trees". 

There are several starting era choices: 

-> Miocene 
-> Lower Paleolithic (tools, fire) 
-> Middle (crude art [beads], multi-tools, language, small bands) 
-> Upper Paleolithic (rope, needles, petroglyphs, first bow, cave painting) 
-> Mesolithic 
-> Neolithic 
-> Copper 
-> Bronze ... 

In order to prevent land-grab too early I am considering several things: 
- revealed areas becoming dark again after short periods (man can't really map large areas at that early time) 
- no settlers at the beginning! (alternative form of settler to create 'camps', 'gathering areas, etc). In Miocene there would not even be that -- much more nomadic gameplay. 
- ice age changes disrupting civilization/land 
- natural disasters (still debating this one) 
- limited expansion once villages can be established 
- progressive resource revelation 
- unit-based (city or civ) bonuses instead of buildings (e.g. hunter, shephard)
- exploration limitations, such as forest civs having penalties in deserts. After all, early "man" took a long time to adapt and migrate. (This one I haven't technically figured out yet.)

PROJECT

I need to "house" this project somewhere and I am new to this modding thing. Any ideas? Does anyone use Github? If I am to work with others I would need to have a collaboration center. What is the typical strategy for this?
