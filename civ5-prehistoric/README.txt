__ KNOWN ISSUES __

This is still in Alpha. I will fix problems as soon as I can. Let me know.

- Strategic View: Some icons don't show up.
- Timed Game: I need to determine the appropriate turn addition to each timed setting. Recommendations and feedback welcomed (always).
- AI improved but still falls short in some places.
- Start date (6000 BC) has comptability issues with other mods (to be fixed or possibly player controlled).
- Lighthouse crash

__ COMPATIBILITY __

*** I strongly advise to download this Mod as the LAST new mod before starting a new game! **
- Other civilizations may not work due to starting bonuses.
- If you like your new civ, let me know and I'll see if I can patch it.
- Does not work with Mods that change GOODY HUTS (Ancient Ruins) or the SCOUT unit.
*** Avoid using Mods that give any benefit AT THE START OF THE GAME, as you might end up unbalancing the game with overpowered units, buildings or features 2000 years too early! ***


__ BUGS AND SUGGESTIONS __

- Please send me your bugs and suggestions. This is my first mod, I would love the help.
- When sending bugs, please tell me the civ you were using, any other mods, and as much details as possible.

__ PREHISTORIC v2.x __

I am creating a much larger mod, more historically accurate and larger in scope, covering a much larger span of man's history (20M BC), optionally starting from the Miocene Age somewhere during bipedal adaption -- "monkeys coming down from the trees". 

There are several starting era choices: 

-> Miocene 
-> Lower Paleolithic (tools, fire) 
-> Middle (crude art [beads], multi-tools, language, small bands) 
-> Upper Paleolithic (rope, needles, petroglyphs, first bow, cave painting) 
-> Mesolithic 
-> Neolithic 
-> Copper 
-> Bronze ... 

In order to prevent land-grab too early I am considering several things: 
- revealed areas becoming dark again after short periods 
- no settlers at the beginning! (alternative form of settler to create 'camps', 'gathering areas'). Very early game would be nomadic without camps.
- ice age changes disrupting civilization and land 
- natural disasters
- limited expansion once villages can be established 
- exploration limitations, such as forest civs having penalties in deserts. After all, early "man" took a long time to adapt and migrate.
