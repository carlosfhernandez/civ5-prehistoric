      <Text>When man started walking upright and using the most basic tools he realized
that some of these tools were not only helpful for self sustenance, hunting, and
bettering his life, but could also be used as weapons that were more effective
than simple brawling and biting.
[NEWLINE]
[NEWLINE]Throwing rocks and hurling them with other tools, like slings, were
effective but not as accurate as the first bow.
[NEWLINE]The first bows had equivalent range as their sling counterparts, but had
more points of lethal contact. It was also easier to establish
competency, although it did take longer to make.
[NEWLINE]
[NEWLINE]These first projectile weapons gave man a much greater range of threat both
in hunting and in combat. Raids on other groups could now be started and
supported with bows from the perimiter. The first bows now gave man the
ability to hide in brush without having to expose himself as with the
sling. It was also much more lethal throwing rocks.</Text>

      <Text>Primitive Archers are very weak in offense and especially defense. They should be next to another unit to attack since they can easily be overwhelmed in melee. This is still a small advantage since they will typically not receive retaliation damage and therefore should be used a support unit with other melee units.</Text>

      <Text>
A weak early ranged unit, using the most primitive of bows. Cheap and self-sufficient.
